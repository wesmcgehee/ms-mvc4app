        <h5>Introduction to Application</h5>
       Is everything information?  A growing number of scientists are beginning to wonder whether information <i>may be primary: more fundamental than matter itself.</i> Reaching this conclusion wasn't easy because the meme was conceived by one of my all-time favorite scientists, the physicist-poet John Wheeler, who died in 2008. In the 1980s, Wheeler started pointing out deep resonances between quantum mechanics and information theory. An electron, Wheeler pointed out, behaves like a particle or a wave depending on how we interrogate it. Information theory, similarly, posits that all messages can be reduced to a sequence of &quot;binary units,&quot; or bits, which are answers to yes or no questions.
